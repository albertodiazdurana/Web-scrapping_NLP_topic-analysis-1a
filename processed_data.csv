The Alafia Consortium, since its creation in 1997, has known, like any other association, stages of evolution and institutional construction.  The initiative initially brought together Benin and Togo in the form of a framework for exchanging and sharing information on microfinance.  With the support of the American NGO Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Benin, 43 microfinance practitioners from the 2 countries began a consultation process from 1996.  This framework has enabled institutions to diagnose the microfinance sector around 3 main problems: (i) institutional problems, (ii) the inadequacy of donor interventions in the microfinance sector and (iii) insufficient synergy between microfinance practitioners.  After a year, the need to create institutional support was revealed.  Thus, the Alafia Consortium was created as a sub-regional network for the development of microfinance.  More details ...

Empowered communities are able to drive change when they recognize everyone's needs, understand their rights and the natural and market forces that affect them, and are able to take collective action. Once empowered, communities are better able to build constructive relationships with government institutions, the private sector and civil society in ways that are sustainable. In turn, local government, the private sector and civil society have a greater ability to address community needs.","Argentina; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Brazil; Colombia; Congo, Democratic Rep; Egypt; Ghana; Haiti; Honduras; India; Indonesia; Iraq; Jordan; Kenya; Kosovo; Lebanon; Liberia; Malawi; Mongolia; Nicaragua; Palestine; Peru; Philippines; Romania; Rwanda; South Sudan; Syria; Tanzania; Turkey; Uganda; Ukraine; United States; Yemen","['Disaster Risk Reduction', 'Education', 'Environment and Climate', 'Financial Consumer Protection', 'Financial Inclusion', 'Food Security and Nutrition', 'Fragile and Conflict-affected Environments', 'Gender Equality', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Livelihoods', 'Market Systems Development', 'MSME Development', 'Rural and Agricultural Development', 'Savings-Led Community Finance', 'Urban Development', 'WASH', 'Youth & Children']","    About Us Careers Translate English French Spanish Arabic COVID-19 Our Impact Overview Annual Reports Awards Interactive Content Whitepapers Financials 990s Where We Work Africa Ghana Kenya Liberia Malawi Rwanda Tanzania DRC Zambia Europe & Asia Romania Ukraine Sri Lanka Kosovo Middle East Egypt Iraq Jordan Lebanon Syria Turkey West Bank/Gaza Yemen The Americas Brazil Colombia Haiti Honduras Nicaragua United States Argentina Our Expertise Meet Our Experts Economic Development Governance & Urban Management Financial Inclusion Humanitarian Assistance Food Security & Agriculture Global Health Civil Society & Capacity Development Infrastructure & Construction Working With Women & Youth Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) News & Resources Global Voices Donate   xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?

Learn About Our Approach Our mission: To empower the poor, especially women, to create a world without poverty and hunger. The poor have the strength and willpower they need to build better lives. What they lack is opportunity. That’s why Grameen Foundation exists. Ours is a People + Technology approach. We design human-centered digital finance and farming solutions to help poor people in developing countries unleash their own capacity. Then we recruit and train some of these people, mostly women, to become Community Agents: trusted neighbors who deliver these tools to their communities. These Grameen Community Agents bring financial inclusion, market access, and resources right to their neighbors’ doorsteps. The result is a chain reaction of benefits for women and families. Incomes and food security increase. Families can pay fees to send their children to school, or to the doctor when sick. They can build assets and endure emergencies. With each Grameen Community Agent reaching 150 families on average, entire communities gain the tools to lift themselves from poverty. In 2016, we set a goal of reaching 25 million people by 2025. So far, we've reached 13 million. Will you help us create a world without poverty? Our comprehensive solution set. Mobile Money Digital financial services give women a better way to manage money.

An integration of this magnitude has never before occurred in the Dutch development sector.  The organizations have pooled their networks, knowledge and infrastructure to increase the impact of their work in developing countries.  The new organization will continue under the name Cordaid, with one head office in The Hague.  Cordaid and ICCO have a similar background and find each other in shared values and Christian inspiration.  Cordaid and ICCO also complement each other well thematically.  Cordaid focuses on health care, education, emergency aid, safety and work and income.  ICCO's expertise is mainly in the field of agriculture: supporting small and medium-sized farmers in making their agriculture more sustainable, in order to create jobs and increase food security.  With this integration, the new organization can fully and effectively deploy itself across the spectrum of relief and development cooperation.  History of ICCO ICCO stands for Inter-Church Coordination Committee for Development Aid.  Founder Jo Verkuyl worked as a missionary in Indonesia.  Verkuyl was one of the few in his day to believe that change is best done at the community level.  Compassion, justice and stewardship: these are the three values with which Verkuyl founded ICCO on December 30, 1964, together with Protestant churches and social organizations in the Netherlands.  ICCO's mission As an independent, non-governmental organization, ICCO has always had a business approach, with the aim of supporting farmers and small businesses in low and middle-income countries.  In this way they can better provide for their own livelihood and gain access to markets.  ICCO's mission is to work for a just society where people have the opportunity to build a decent life, by strengthening sustainable agricultural systems and making communities resilient.  ICCO pays special attention to women, young people and people who work in small and medium-sized businesses.  Goals of ICCO On the basis of three concrete goals, ICCO creates resilient communities that can respond well to disasters and are prepared for bad times.  Food security We support individual households in the production of food crops, so that they themselves receive sufficient good nutrition and at the same time can earn an income from agriculture.  Economic independence We help farmers and producer organizations seize economic opportunities that improve the lives of small farmers.  Emergency relief We create resilient communities that can respond to disasters and are prepared for bad times.  ICCO projects ICCO projects ensure sustainable, small-scale and viable agriculture by teaching farmers and small entrepreneurs how to strengthen their position in value chains.  The farmers are supported in all steps in the production of edible crops.  So not only in sowing, cultivating and harvesting, but also in the storage, processing, transport and marketing of food and waste processing.  This helps people who otherwise have difficulty accessing regional and international markets, such as women, young people and farmers with physical disabilities.  We are initiating a transformation of agricultural systems so that they become sustainable, both financially and ecologically.  This systemic change requires a long-term attitude and approach in which we involve all stakeholders: farmers and other companies involved in transport, packaging and distribution of food products, as well as marketers and consumers.  Even after the joining of forces with Cordaid in 2021, these projects will continue to exist and give millions of people in the most difficult areas in the world a fair chance for a dignified existence.  Companies ICCO has set up several companies: Truvalu Truvalu develops fair and inclusive agri-food chains.  FairClimateFund FairClimateFund provides poor households access to clean cooking by trading carbon credits.  Fair & Sustainable Holding Fair & Sustainable Consulting offers development cooperation services.

Read our vision    Remembering Justice Ginsburg On Friday, September 18th, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Brooklyn-born champion of women’s rights and gender equality – and second woman in history to sit on the bench of the U.S. Supreme Court – passed her torch to the next generation, leaving behind a legacy unparalleled. As a woman, mother, and daughter of Jewish immigrants, Ginsburg faced the very same discrimination she would spend decades fighting in the courtroom. She devoted her life to lifting up others and breaking down the barriers that faced them. Rest in power, Justice Ginsburg. Read ICRW’s full statement.  About Our Work Gender inequity lies at the root of every major problem the world faces. And so gender must inform every solution, from creating sustainable business practices, to expanding opportunities for youth, to addressing the ever-changing health challenges globally. ICRW meets the world’s problems with proof. We conduct pioneering research that has illuminated our understanding of why child marriage still happens, and how to prevent it. We have contributed to a deeper understanding of how men and women make decisions around sex and family planning. And we have worked to improve conditions for women throughout a major corporate supply chain, from garment factory to retail floor. Driven by our vision of equity for all, our researchers dig into the ways gender shapes societies and the ways people’s lives are diminished by power imbalances. When we find the proof, we take it out into the light and transform it into answers. Answers that power our advocacy. Answers that inform our consulting. Answers that animate our program design. ICRW brings proof to power, and that makes all the difference in the world.   Passion. Proof.

One Time   Monthly   $200   $100   $50     Other Ways to Give   The Challenge Farming by nature is risky business, but it is also a necessary part of how the entire world has access to nutritious food. Farmers are on the front lines of adapting to challenges created by climate change, invasive pests like fall armyworm and locusts, crop diseases, and other destabilizing shocks. Together, we can help farmers in Africa to chart a path to a better future, and help end extreme poverty in some of the toughest places on earth .  Watch the Video   Our Approach While farming is risky by nature, there is also incredible potential in vulnerable, rural farming communities. By working together with them, we can help them chart a path to a better future, and support them as they move from subsistence to contributing to the global food supply. Together, we can help farmers and their families not only lift themselves out of poverty, but also build thriving locally-led businesses in their communities by establishing cooperatives. Families are able to lift themselves out of poverty and stay out .  What We Do Our Story Founded by a former US Marine, formed at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, and fueled by angel investors from Silicon Valley as well as foundations and individuals from around the world, Nuru’s story is one of innovation, adaptation, and impact to help eradicate extreme poverty in our lifetime.  Read More Our Model The Nuru model is distinctive in its development of a “sustainability engine” which employs a leadership development program that restores agency to local leaders and equips them to build and scale poverty fighting solutions after the intentional exit of expatriate staff.  Read More Our Team While Nuru staff technically work for separate and distinct locally-run organizations based in various countries, we all operate under a shared vision to cultivate lasting, meaningful choices in the most vulnerable and marginalized communities in the world.  Meet Our Team  Nuru helps communities and households to build resilience in the face of instability created by factors like  Climate Change The people who are the most vulnerable to changing weather patterns and climate-related shocks are smallholder farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture. Nuru enables farmers to adapt to climate change through climate-smart agriculture practices.  Pests When threats like fall armyworm, locusts swarms, or other pests threaten our farmers, Nuru responds with timely and specific information and resources to enable farmers to navigate the challenge and continue moving forward in the face of adversity.  Unreliable Markets In addition to other risks and challenges, rural farmers need to have access to a reliable and consistent place to sell their surplus. Nuru works together with farmer-owned cooperatives to identify reliable markets so farmers can move from subsistence farming to farming as a viable business.  COVID-19 Our entire world has been changed by COVID-19. Nuru works together with farmers to enable them to continue their important work while maintaining healthy practices that prevent the spread of coronavirus.  State Fragility Whether it is the emerging threat of violent extremist organizations or a national state of emergency, Nuru helps farmers navigate through unstable conditions, and move from desperation to hope.

Handouts It's not okay that most solutions are focused on physical 'handouts', which do little more than put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. Our approach is different. Instead of handouts, you’ll be creating sustainable development through the local church . But, it’s more than empowering people to help them overcome poverty.

Lily lives in the Rhino Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda. She is one of the more than 1.5 million South Sudanese who have fled their war-torn homeland for the safety of Uganda. Every day she woke up and made porridge for her five children along with three orphans she cared for, collected firewood for the stove, and then waited for the day to end. Like most refugees in the camps, Lily’s family depended on the beans and corn that the United Nations distributed once a month to keep her family from starving. But finding the funds to send the children to school, or to treat them when they fell ill, was impossible. The feeling of hopelessness began to dissipate when Lily and two partners received the opportunity to start a business with the help of Village Enterprise. Lily, Jane, and Asuku opened a restaurant, using their initial grant to rent space and cookware and to buy the ingredients needed to make the food. In just a few weeks, their business began to grow. Now when you enter Lily, Jane, and Asuku’s restaurant, the smell of caramelized onions and simmering beans fills the space with a welcoming aroma. Lily and her partners use their profits to buy vegetables for a more balanced diet and to pay for their children’s school fees. They are also saving money to build a larger restaurant. “I feel proud to see people eating our food,” Lily confessed proudly. “We want to run a good restaurant. Eventually we’ll open a larger one…. Now when we wake up, we have hope. ”  ×  Dinah Cherlonlaten Started her business in June 2013 Soy, Kenya Dinah with the painted “MPesa” Dinah Cherlonlaten stands in front of her shop in a purple dress that complements the painted letters on her house that read “MPesa”, a mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinance service used widely in Kenya. Today she earns $120 a month as an MPesa agent. Six years ago, after participating in the Village Enterprise program, Dinah started a small shop in her home selling sugar, soap, and vegetables. But Dinah and her business partners soon had competitors, so they decided to diversify and add MPesa to their offerings. In addition, Dinah bought a motorcycle and hired a man to transport community members for a small fee. Dinah is a widow with five children. She is now financially independent, an accomplishment that has brought her great pride. “ People see me as a person who has changed her life ,” Dinah declares. With savings from her business, she replaced the dirt floor of her house with concrete.  Her home is neat and clean, with white lace doilies carefully draped over the couch cushions, and her living space is free from bugs and dirt. She has also purchased a TV, bought land to grow corn to supplement her family’s meals, and buys the best school shoes for her children.  ×  Joseph Nyaranga and Rose Naliak Nyongesa Started their business in March 2016 Kitale, Kenya Joseph and Rose at work in their shop. Today Joseph and Rose run a flourishing tailoring business, but their success was far from assured. One day when Joseph was young, the school headmaster arrived and told every child who wasn’t wearing the school uniform to stand up and leave the building. He could never afford to return. And when he couldn’t pay for uniforms for his own children, they were sent home as well. The cycle was repeating. Joseph joined the Village Enterprise program to learn the basics of running a small business. “ As a school dropout, I found the training very, very helpful….I came from nothing, but now I’m something.” With an initial grant of $150, Joseph and his two business partners bought fabric and rented a sewing machine to make dresses and school uniforms. The business grew rapidly and soon couldn’t handle the steady stream of orders. Rose had always had an interest in tailoring but couldn’t learn due to lack of money. Now they could afford to teach her. Soon she and the other partners sewed constantly to keep up with the growing demand. Joseph and Rose now allow parents to pay for uniforms in installments, thus realizing his dream of helping children end the cycle and stay in school. As he begins hemming the bottom of a red dress, Joseph smiles and says he’s proud of what they have built. His customers happily tell him how often they are asked, “Where did you get that dress?”  ×  Carolyn Nawire Started her business in November 2017 Soy, Kenya Carolyn in front of her new house. In 2004, Carolyn Nawire’s husband died, leaving her and her seven children destitute. She planted crops on a small plot of land she owned and tried to make enough money to support herself and her family. But there was never enough. Carolyn’s life changed when she met Village Enterprise business mentor Eunice Kiombe, who invited her to a meeting to learn how to start a business and, just as important, how to start saving money. At first Carolyn was skeptical, but she agreed to take a chance. That moment changed her life forever. With her business partners, Carolyn started selling fish. Soon they found that there was significant competition, so they switched to selling corn and perfume. This was initially successful, but when there was no corn available due to drought they returned to selling fish. With the increased sales, Carolyn was able to open her first savings account. Recently Carolyn built a new house of concrete—right next to her old house of mud and sticks, which has now fallen apart. It’s a striking symbol of the drastic way Carolyn’s life has changed. Carolyn lives in her new home with eight of her eleven grandchildren and, thanks to her savings, is able to pay for all of their school fees. Carolyn now has plans to buy a plot of land in town and construct houses to rent. Carolyn says with a laugh, “ I feel very, very happy. Fish changed my life. With my money I can doing anything I want.”  ×  Juliet Agemo Started her business in 2011 Ngora, Uganda Juliet Agemo Juliet Agemo is a testament to how hard work and opportunity can change lives. Ten years ago, Juliet was under-nourished, so thin you could see the bones in her face. She ate just one meal a day, usually porridge, but sometimes skipped days to buy medicine for one of her three children. School fees were so high they seemed out of reach. She longed to be a teacher, but that also seemed an impossible dream. When Juliet was invited to participate in the Village Enterprise program with two partners, she never thought it would end up transforming her and her family’s lives. With their grant, the partners bought a few lambs, which quickly multiplied and turned into many, many sheep. They sold the ewes, shared the profits, and decided to begin buying and selling pork as a way to diversify their enterprise. This was the beginning of their highly successful pork business in Ngora. Once the business was established, Juliet approached her partners and asked if they would be willing to help her return to school to learn to teach. They agreed. In 2015, Juliet graduated as a teacher. “ I love the work of being a nursery school teacher,” said Juliet. “My students will help Uganda. They will be the next Members of Parliament and doctors.” Juliet and her partners have also continued to build their business. Over the past eight years, they have used some of their profits to buy 325 citrus trees. Now they own a massive orchard and will soon be selling the fruit to buyers who come from neighboring Rwanda and Kenya. “Village Enterprise helped us a lot, most especially me,” Juliet said. She smiles broadly with her full, round, healthy face. “I can afford to drink milk and eat meat now. I used to be so small. I never thought I’d be like this.”  ×  Ruth Epegai Started her business in 2013 Ngora, Uganda Ruth standing in front of her home Ruth dreamed of living in a peaceful, sturdy house surrounded by orange trees. For years this seemed impossible. She survived on the small amount of money she made from selling illegally-brewed alcohol. Ruth’s compound was continuously full of men who came to drink and socialize; it was loud and dirty. It also wasn’t very profitable because so many people would drink without paying. Six years later Ruth’s home is an island of serenity: her beautiful house, surrounded by orange and mango trees, is quiet and peaceful. Friends and family sit around the compound talking. Sometimes a radio plays the news. “I’m living like someone in town,” Ruth said. “If Village Enterprise hadn’t come, I never could have done this.” Ruth and her two business partners received a small grant and business training from Village Enterprise. With part of the money, they raised turkeys and pigs. They also purchased mango and orange seedlings, and when they began to produce fruit, sold their bounty at local markets. These various initiatives allowed Ruth to save enough money to begin molding bricks for a house. She feels so happy that Village Enterprise and her partners helped her realize a dream she long thought impossible. Her hard work also put her four children through school, one of whom completed university and is now a teacher. Ruth believes her businesses have been successful because she worked with a group of people who were equally committed to and shared the same goal: they all wanted to educate their children. Today, Ruth still has her turkey business. She and her fellow business owners share the responsibility of caring for the birds.  ×  Okum Goro (Support The Weak People) Business Group Lokot Ketty, Abur Pamela, and Adong Jackline Started in 2018 Nwoya, Uganda Pamela cutting out donuts “We feel empowered,” declares Pamela, a donut maker in Nwoya, Uganda. “Every time we move in the community, we move with our heads held high.” But their lives weren’t always this way. As recently as last year, Pamela and two of her friends, Jackline and Ketty, had reached the end of their rope. “We were just sitting at home every day,” Jackline explains. “We had no way to make any money.” Ketty had previously taken a bakery training class in a nearby town, but she lacked the capital and know-how to translate her training into a profitable business. Then Village Enterprise came to their village. After joining the Village Enterprise program, the three women decided to open a donut shop. Pamela taught her partners the art of donut making, and the three women now work together every day making their sweet treats and selling them in the local and community markets.  After running their donut business for just a few months, the three women now proudly proclaim, “We are no longer beggars.” “Before,” adds Jackline, “I would ask my relatives and husband for money. But now I am independent. I have my own source of money.” One of the best things about their business is the peace of mind it has provided the women. Ketty’s one-year-old son has epilepsy. Before the business, she worried about hospital fees and whether she could to help her son when he had a seizure. Now, she is confident that she can take care of her child.  ×",False,to end extreme poverty in rural africa through entrepreneurship and innovation,           search  blog          ​     blog  what we

sewing machine to make dresses and school uniforms the business grew rapidly and soon couldn’t handle the steady stream of orders rose had always had an interest in tailoring but couldn’t learn due to lack of money now they could afford to teach her soon she and the other partners sewed constantly to keep up with the growing demand joseph and rose now allow parents to pay for uniforms in installments thus realizing his dream of helping children end the cycle and stay in school as he begins hemming the bottom of a red dress joseph smiles and says he’s proud of what they have built his customers happily tell him how often they are asked “where did you get that dress”  ×  carolyn nawire started her business in november 2017 soy kenya carolyn in front of her new house in 2004 carolyn nawire’s husband died leaving her and her seven children destitute she planted crops on a small plot of land she owned and tried to make enough money to support herself and her family but there was never enough carolyn’s life changed when she met village enterprise business mentor eunice kiombe who invited her to a meeting to learn how to start a business and just as important how to start saving money at first carolyn was skeptical but she agreed to take a chance that moment changed her life forever with her business partners carolyn started selling fish soon they found that there was significant competition so they switched to selling corn and perfume this was initially successful but when there was no corn available due to drought they returned to selling fish with the increased sales carolyn was able to open her first savings account recently carolyn built a new house of concrete—right next to her old house of mud and sticks which has now fallen apart it’s a striking symbol of the drastic way carolyn’s life has changed carolyn lives in her new home with eight of her eleven grandchildren and thanks to her savings is able to pay for all of their school fees carolyn now has plans to buy a plot of land in town and construct houses to rent carolyn says with a laugh “ i feel very very happy fish changed my life with my money i can doing anything i want”  ×  juliet agemo started her business in 2011 ngora uganda juliet agemo juliet agemo is a testament to how hard work and opportunity can change lives ten years ago juliet was under-nourished so thin you could see the bones in her face she ate just one meal a day usually porridge but sometimes skipped days to buy medicine for one of her three children school fees were so high they seemed out of reach she longed to be a teacher but that also seemed an impossible dream when juliet was invited to participate in the village enterprise program with two partners she never thought it would end up transforming her and her family’s lives with their grant the partners bought a few lambs which quickly multiplied and turned into many many sheep they sold the ewes shared the profits and decided to begin buying and selling pork as a way to diversify their enterprise this was the beginning of their highly successful pork business in ngora once the business was established juliet approached her partners and asked if they would be willing to help her return to school to learn to teach they agreed in 2015 juliet graduated as a teacher “ i love the work of being a nursery school teacher” said juliet “my students will help uganda they will be the next members of parliament and doctors” juliet and her partners have also continued to build their business over the past eight years they have used some of their profits to buy 325 citrus trees now they own a massive orchard and will soon be selling the fruit to buyers who come from neighboring rwanda and kenya “village enterprise helped us a lot most especially me” juliet said she smiles broadly with her full round healthy face “i can afford to drink milk and eat meat now i used to be so small i never thought i’d be like this”  ×  ruth epegai started her business in 2013 ngora uganda ruth standing in front of her home ruth dreamed of living in a peaceful sturdy house surrounded by orange trees for years this seemed impossible she survived on the small amount of money she made from selling illegally-brewed alcohol ruth’s compound was continuously full of men who came to drink and socialize; it was loud and dirty it also wasn’t very profitable because so many people would drink without paying six years later ruth’s home is an island of serenity: her beautiful house surrounded by orange and mango trees is quiet and peaceful friends and family sit around the compound talking sometimes a radio plays the news “i’m living like someone in town” ruth said “if village enterprise hadn’t come i never could have done this” ruth and her two business partners received a small grant and business training from village enterprise with part of the money they raised turkeys and pigs they also purchased mango and orange seedlings and when they began to produce fruit sold their bounty at local markets these various initiatives allowed ruth to save enough money to begin molding bricks for a house she feels so happy that village enterprise and her partners helped her realize a dream she long thought impossible her hard work also put her four children through school one of whom completed university and is now a teacher ruth believes her businesses have been successful because she worked with a group of people who were equally committed to and shared the same goal: they all wanted to educate their children today ruth still has her turkey business she and her fellow business owners share the responsibility of caring for the birds  ×  okum goro (support the weak people) business group lokot ketty abur pamela and adong jackline started in 2018 nwoya uganda pamela cutting out donuts “we feel empowered” declares pamela a donut maker in nwoya uganda “every time we move in the community we move with our heads held high” but their lives weren’t always this way as recently as last year pamela and two of her friends jackline and ketty had reached the end of their rope “we were just sitting at home every day” jackline explains “we had no way to make any money” ketty had previously taken a bakery training class in a nearby town but she lacked the capital and know-how to translate her training into a profitable business then village enterprise came to their village after joining the village enterprise program the three women decided to open a donut shop pamela taught her partners the art of donut making and the three women now work together every day making their sweet treats and selling them in the local and community markets  after running their donut business for just a few months the three women now proudly proclaim “we are no longer beggars” “before” adds jackline “i would ask my relatives and husband for money but now i am independent i have my own source of money” one of the best things about their business is the peace of mind it has provided the women ketty’s one-year-old son has epilepsy before the business she worried about hospital fees and whether she could to help her son when he had a seizure now she is confident that she can take care of her child  ×
