The names for the savings group phenomenon vary by country: what is called stokvel in South Africa, chama in Kenya, and susu in Ghana may differ in detail, but the concepts have striking similarities. SGs have a strong cultural connotation, as illustrated by the link between Kenya’s Chamas with harambee – Swahili for “all pull together” and so central to Kenyan culture that it is enshrined in the country’s coat of arms. The ecosystems surrounding savings groups vary substantially between countries. Our research aims to capture these differences in an encyclopedic form, resulting in the publication of a booklet on the comprehensive findings","Angola; Botswana; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Congo, DRC; Cote d'Ivoire; Ethiopia; Kenya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mali; Mozambique; Portugal; Rwanda; Senegal; South Africa; Tanzania; Togo; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe",Education; Financial Inclusion; MSME Development; Youth & Children
